## 1.1.0

* Initialize React Project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) (react-ts)

## 1.0.0

* Initialized the project as a [PNPM Workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) + Monorepo with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).
  Why Monorepo? We will be sharing types and interfaces between the two applications Frontend and Backend Applications.
  This is a best practice for modern Applications and Turborepo is one of the best tools I have used personally for Javascript Monorepo Projects.
